# Bash script development

## Shebang

You can use [/usr/bin/env](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Env "Env") to find interpreter in the `$PATH` (see
[Shebang (Unix). Program_location - Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)#Program_location>)):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

## Current working directory or script directory

You don't have to worry about calling scripts from a "magic" directory, such as the project root. Instead, take care of
locating the script in the file system. This way you can determine the paths to the files you need based on the
structure of the project and its location without making assumptions about how this script was called.

[Dave Dopson](https://stackoverflow.com/users/407731) on Stackowerflow wrote a great
[guide on how to determine the directory where the script is located](https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128):

______________________________________________________________________

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

SCRIPT_DIR=$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &>/dev/null && pwd)
```

is a useful one-liner which will give you the full directory name of the script no matter where it is being called from.

It will work as long as the last component of the path used to find the script is not a symlink (directory links are
OK). If you also want to resolve any links to the script itself, you need a multi-line solution:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

SOURCE=${BASH_SOURCE[0]}
while [ -L "$SOURCE" ]; do # resolve $SOURCE until the file is no longer a symlink
  DIR=$(cd -P "$(dirname "$SOURCE")" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd)
  SOURCE=$(readlink "$SOURCE")
  [[ $SOURCE != /* ]] && SOURCE=$DIR/$SOURCE # if $SOURCE was a relative symlink, we need to resolve it relative to the path where the symlink file was located
done
DIR=$(cd -P "$(dirname "$SOURCE")" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd)
```

This last one will work with any combination of aliases, `source`, `bash -c`, symlinks, etc.

**Beware:** if you `cd` to a different directory before running this snippet, the result may be incorrect!

Also, watch out for [`$CDPATH` gotchas](http://bosker.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/bash-scripters-beware-of-the-cdpath/),
and stderr output side effects if the user has smartly overridden cd to redirect output to stderr instead (including
escape sequences, such as when calling `update_terminal_cwd >&2` on Mac). Adding `>/dev/null 2>&1` at the end of your
`cd` command will take care of both possibilities.

To understand how it works, try running this more verbose form:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

SOURCE=${BASH_SOURCE[0]}
while [ -L "$SOURCE" ]; do # resolve $SOURCE until the file is no longer a symlink
  TARGET=$(readlink "$SOURCE")
  if [[ $TARGET == /* ]]; then
    echo "SOURCE '$SOURCE' is an absolute symlink to '$TARGET'"
    SOURCE=$TARGET
  else
    DIR=$(dirname "$SOURCE")
    echo "SOURCE '$SOURCE' is a relative symlink to '$TARGET' (relative to '$DIR')"
    SOURCE=$DIR/$TARGET # if $SOURCE was a relative symlink, we need to resolve it relative to the path where the symlink file was located
  fi
done
echo "SOURCE is '$SOURCE'"
RDIR=$(dirname "$SOURCE")
DIR=$(cd -P "$(dirname "$SOURCE")" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd)
if [ "$DIR" != "$RDIR" ]; then
  echo "DIR '$RDIR' resolves to '$DIR'"
fi
echo "DIR is '$DIR'"
```

And it will print something like:

```
SOURCE './scriptdir.sh' is a relative symlink to 'sym2/scriptdir.sh' (relative to '.')
SOURCE is './sym2/scriptdir.sh'
DIR './sym2' resolves to '/home/ubuntu/dotfiles/fo fo/real/real1/real2'
DIR is '/home/ubuntu/dotfiles/fo fo/real/real1/real2'
```

______________________________________________________________________

For scripts used in project development, a simple use case will suffice:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

SCRIPT_DIR=$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &>/dev/null && pwd)
```

For scripts that can be used when using the project, it is worth considering the existence of symbolic links to scripts:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

SOURCE=${BASH_SOURCE[0]}
while [ -L "$SOURCE" ]; do # resolve $SOURCE until the file is no longer a symlink
  DIR=$(cd -P "$(dirname "$SOURCE")" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd)
  SOURCE=$(readlink "$SOURCE")
  [[ $SOURCE != /* ]] && SOURCE=$DIR/$SOURCE # if $SOURCE was a relative symlink, we need to resolve it relative to the path where the symlink file was located
done
DIR=$(cd -P "$(dirname "$SOURCE")" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd)
```

If you use Argbash, you can use
[DEFINE_SCRIPT_DIR and DEFINE_SCRIPT_DIR_GNU convenience macros](https://argbash.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html#script-dir).

## Resolve paths

We can use the [_readlink_](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/readlink.1.html) command to resolve relative
paths, including symlinks. It uses the _-f_ flag to print the full path:

```bash
$ readlink -f /usr/../tmp/link
/tmp/real
```

Here /tmp/_link_ is a symlink to the /tmp/_real_ file.

_readlink -f_ returns a non-zero exit-code only if it is called with a non-existent directory but returns zero if the
file’s directory exists. So, _readlink -f /tmp/non-existent_ will return 0, _but readlink -f
/non-existent-dir/non-existent-file_ will return 1

Finally, we have the [_realpath_](https://linux.die.net/man/1/realpath) command, which behaves similarly to _readlink
-f_:

```bash
$ realpath /tmp/non-existent
echo $?
/tmp/non-existent
0
$ realpath /non-existent-dir/non-existent-file
echo $?
realpath: /non-existent-dir: No such file or directory
1
$ realpath /tmp/link
/tmp/real
```
