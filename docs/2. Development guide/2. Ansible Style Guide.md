## Directory Structure

A consistent directory structure is important to easily understand all playbooks and roles which are written. Ansible
knows many different folder structures, any can be used. However, it is important to stick to one structure.

The following is an example. Not all folders are usually used and working with collections will change such structure a
little bit.

```

├── ansible.cfg
├── ansible_modules
├── group_vars
│   ├── webservers
│   └── all
├── hosts
│   ├── webserver01
│   └── webserver02
├── host_vars
├── modules
├── playbooks
│   └── ansible-cmdb.yml
└── roles
    ├── requirements.yml
    └── galaxy
