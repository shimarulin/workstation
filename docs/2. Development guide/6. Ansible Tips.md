# Ansible Tips

## Run dependencies only once in multiple plays in Ansible

https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/17822/run-dependencies-only-once-in-muliple-plays-in-ansible

- Use the task _import_role_ and put all roles into the single playbook

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - import_role:
        name: roleA
      when: inventory_hostname in groups.my_servers
    - import_role:
        name: roleB
      when: inventory_hostname in groups.special_servers
    - import_role:
        name: roleC
      when: inventory_hostname in groups.other_servers
```

See
[Ansible only executes role dependencies once](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#running-role-dependencies-multiple-times-in-one-play)

______________________________________________________________________

- The 'deduplication' doesn't work if you run the roles in multiple plays

```yaml
shell> cat pb.yml
- hosts: my_servers
  roles:
    - roleA

- hosts: special_servers
  roles:
    - roleB

- hosts: other_servers
  roles:
    - roleC
```

In this case, you can skip the tasks in the role _common_ if already been completed. For example, create a control
variable

```yaml
shell> cat roles/common/tasks/main.yml
- block:
    - include_tasks: tasks.yml
    - set_fact:
        role_common_completed:  true
  when: not role_common_completed|d(false)
```

```yaml
shell> cat roles/common/tasks/tasks.yml
- debug:
    msg: "{{ ansible_role_name }} running on {{ inventory_hostname }}"
```

Test it. Given the project

```bash
shell >tree .
.
├── ansible.cfg
├── hosts
├── pb.yml
└── roles
├── common
│   └── tasks
│   ├── main.yml
│   └── tasks.yml

│   │   └── main.yml

12 directories, 11 files
```

```ini
shell> cat ansible.cfg
[defaults]
gathering = explicit
collections_path = $HOME/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/
inventory = $PWD/hosts
roles_path = $PWD/roles
retry_files_enabled = false
stdout_callback = yaml
```

```ini
shell> cat hosts
[my_servers]
host_A
host_B
host_C

[special_servers]
host_A
host_B

[other_servers]
host_C
```

All role\* meta and tasks files are the same

```yaml
shell> cat roles/role*/tasks/main.yml
- debug:
    msg: "{{ ansible_role_name }} running on {{ inventory_hostname }}"
  ...
```

```yaml
shell> cat roles/role*/meta/main.yml
dependencies:
  - common
...
```

The playbook gives (abridged)

```yaml
shell> ansible-playbook pb.yml | grep msg:
  msg: common running on host_A
  msg: common running on host_B
  msg: common running on host_C
  msg: roleA running on host_A
  msg: roleA running on host_B
  msg: roleA running on host_C
  msg: roleB running on host_A
  msg: roleB running on host_B
  msg: roleC running on host_C
```

You can see that each host keeps the 'control' variable. If you add another group to the inventory. For example,

```ini
shell> cat hosts
  ...
[backup]
host_X
host_Y
```

and add another play to the playbook

```yaml
shell> cat pb.yml
  ...
- hosts: backup
  roles:
    - roleC
```

The playbook gives (abridged)

```yaml
shell> ansible-playbook pb.yml | grep msg:
  msg: common running on host_A
  msg: common running on host_B
  msg: common running on host_C
  msg: roleA running on host_A
  msg: roleA running on host_C
  msg: roleA running on host_B
  msg: roleB running on host_A
  msg: roleB running on host_B
  msg: roleC running on host_C
  msg: common running on host_X
  msg: common running on host_Y
  msg: roleC running on host_X
  msg: roleC running on host_Y
```
